# JSON and APIs

## JSON

### What does it stand for?
JSON stands for 'JavaScript Object Notation'.

### What is it used for?
JSON is a text-based format for storing and exchanging data in a way that is both human-readable and machine-processable.
Since the format is text only, it can be used by any programming language.
JSON is used to transfer data between different computers/systems.
It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

### What is it written in?
It was derived from the JavaScript programming language, but is programming language independent.
It is not really code, think of it as text.

### What data types can it store/use?
- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- Arrays
- Objects (dictionary)
- Null

### What is the JSON syntax for:
- Name value pairs:<br>
```
"name": "value"
```
- Objects (collection of name-value pairs):<br>
```
 {"key1": "value1"}
```
- How to separate data objects from one another:<br>
```
{"key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"}
```
- JSON arrays (these are like lists in python):<br>
```
{"key1": ["value1","value2"]}
```
